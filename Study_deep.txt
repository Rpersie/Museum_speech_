# Handwriting analysis using Neural Networks::
	
	# start with tensorflow's simple handwritten digits recognizer 
		-- make it work in your sytem
	
	# Go for handwritten characters recognizer
	       	-- Refer :
			1) https://youtu.be/PO4hePKWIGQ
		-- After recognition try applying simple rules to decide personality based on cerrtain characters
		  

# Start With Tensorflow
