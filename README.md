# PROJECT IDEA HUB : (Bucket in your ideas)


## 1) Museum_Guide
### Proposed Automated Guide for museum:
     
      
#### Ideas:
  1. Guide will follow a person Using object tracking (maybe a colored label sticked to the person)
  2. The guide responds to human commands and shares information about museum. (Using Speech Recognition)
  3. Context based specific QA (Question Answers) session by the guide
     - Based on it's current available information about the museum.
     - Proposed implementation :(DeepQA)chatbots

  4. The Guide is capable of Recognize Artifacts
     - (Using image processing and Specific Object Recognition module )

  5. The Guide is capable of Recognizing Specific Faces
     - The guide can distinguish between the museum staff and the visitors.
  6. The Guide is capable of Recognizing Specific Faces 
  
  7. Create a specific path for the robot to move  aI can detect the proximity of the visitors

  8. If no one is listening then he can stop


 #### Hardware can be 
  1. Rasberry pi
  2. ARM kit
  
   
  
 #### software (We can go for)
  ##### 1. Python
  ##### 2. MATLAB
