### Proposed Automated Guide for museum:
     
      
#### Ideas:
  1. Guide will follow a person Using object tracking (maybe a colored label sticked to the person)

  3. Context based specific QA (Question Answers) session by the guide
     - Based on it's current available information about the museum.
     - Proposed implementation :(DeepQA)chatbots

  4. The Guide is capable of Recognize Artifacts
     - (Using image processing and Specific Object Recognition module )

  5. The Guide is capable of Recognizing Specific Faces
     - The guide can distinguish between the museum staff and the visitors.
  6. The Guide is capable of Recognizing Specific Faces 
  
  7. Create a specific path for the robot to move  aI can detect the proximity of the visitors

  8. If no one is listening then he can stop
