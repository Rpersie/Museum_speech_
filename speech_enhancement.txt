	** Noise Reduction (Denoising)
		- microphone based noise
		- Electrical noise
		- Environmental Noise

	** Speech Enhancement
		
		# Most widely used method:
			
			- Spectral Subtraction  (for better noise cancellation)
				-- oldest and simplest
		
		# Comparison of Speech enhancement Techniques :
	
			- Weiner Filtering
			- Adaptive Kalman Filter
			- Perceptual Weighting Filter
	
			**NOTE:  According to ( http://www.iosrjen.org/Papers/vol3_issue10%20(part-3)/G031033744.pdf )
				**perceptual Weighting Filter manifested better noise cancellation and consumed less cpu time.

	** Far-Field Speech recognition:
		- Acoustinc Echo Cancellation
		- Beamforming (Using Multiple microphone arrays)
